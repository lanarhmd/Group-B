d. Brief Description of the case study

We are from group B that has been assigned to create an Event Management System. We are using html, css and php
in order to create this system. Basically, this simple system contains 30/31 days based on the month of the year. 
Our event is a full day event meaning, only one event per day. Since it is a full day event, the most crucial thing
is the date and it is first comes, first served basis. There will be no clashes of events on the same date.
